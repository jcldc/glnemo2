 Glnemo2 is  an interactive visualization 3D program  , using OpenGL and trolltech 
QT 4.X API. It displays in 3D, particles positions of the different components of an 
nbody snapshot. 

 You can zoom in/out, rotate, scale, translate, select different particles 
and plot them in different blending colors, color particles according to their density,
play with the density threshold, trace orbits, play different time steps, take automatic
screenshots to make movies, select particles using the mouse, fly over your simulation 
using camera path. All this features are accessible from a very intuitive graphic user interface.

Currently, glnemo2 reads:
- NEMO files (http://carma.astro.umd.edu/nemo)
- Gadget 1 and 2 -little and big endian- files (http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/gadget/)
- RAMSES files (http://irfu.cea.fr/Projets/Site_ramses/RAMSES.html)
- FTM files (Clayton Heller's sph/nbody code)
- phiGRAPE file (http://wiki.cs.rit.edu/bin/view/GRAPEcluster/phiGRAPE)
- list of files stored in a file
- realtime gyrfalcON simulation via a network plugin (see $NEMO/usr/jcl/glnemo2/gyrfalcon/README)

 Noticed that a "lite" version of the NEMO's engine I/O  is included inside the glnemo2 
package so you don't longer need to download the whole NEMO package to compile it.

 Glnemo2 uses a plugin mechanism to load data, so it's easy to add a new file reader.
It uses the latest OpenGL technology like, shaders (glsl), vertex buffer object, 
frame buffer object, and takes in account the power of your graphic card to accelerate the
rendering. Millions of particles can be rendered, in real time, with a fast GPU. With this
technology, glnemo2 can be 1000% times faster than glnemo1 !

 Glnemo2 runs fine on Linux, Windows(using minGW compiler), and MaxOSX, thanks to the QT4 API.
