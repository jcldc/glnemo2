   saved in the correct file format according to the extension name
 - bug fixed: bestzoom deactivated for the first playing frame

preview.2010-May-19 (aka Leiden Release)
-----------------------------------------
 - remove mindens maxdens from command line parameters
 - add minphys and maxphys to set minimum and maximum physical value
 - add selphys to select the physical quantity to display
 - auto_render command line parameter added
   if true, guess the best rendering mode, otherwise use accumulation buffer
 - glnemo2 no more crash when it displays a number of orbits
   lesser than 20
 - fix a bug about the rendering mode changing from time to time
 - set correctly min/man physical quantity with respecting slide
 - draw correctly histo view

preview.2010-April-24
---------------------
  can select times with list of snapshots
  add experimental Ramses reader (gas,halo,stars)
  add gyrfalcON's runtime manipulator (see $NEMO/usr/jcl/glnemo2/gyrfalcon/README)
  add clean installer (make install => glnemo2 install in $NEMOBIN)
  add glnemo2 manual (man glnemo2)
  many bugs fixed

preview.2010-Feb-15
-------------------
  fix a bug on gadget2 file with BNDRY data

preview.2010-Feb-03
-------------------
  glnemo2 can render automatically all the time steps of a snapshot, if 
  from the command line, input parameters screenshot has a value  and play=t.  

  Support added for Gadget2 file in multiple data file. 

preview.2009-Oct-23
-------------------
- new input parameters enhance screenshot from the command line:
   - mindens   : set minimum density threshold
   - maxdens   : set maximum density threshold
   - com       : boolean to center according to the center of mass 
   - cmapindex : give the colormap index
- colormap can be selected directly from the user interface

- experimental temperature display

1.preview.2009-Jul-16
----------------------
- huge speed up on the rendering engine (up to 1000% !), thanks to :
   - vertex buffer object
   - vertex and pixel shader (via glsl)
   - GL_POINT_SPRITE_ARB and GL_VERTEX_PROGRAM_POINT_SIZE_NV

- density rendering engine, to display and color particles according to their
  density and the distance of their Kth neighbours. It works with gadget2
  snapshots with gas components, and with NEMO snapshots with density field.

- offscreen rendering, using frame buffer object, to take screenshot from the command line and from the GUI

- new input file format phiGRAPE

- possibility to record and display orbits

- list of files does not need header anymore

- camera path using b-splines, to fly over the simulation

- **TONS** of bugs fixed

1.preview.080327
----------------
First public release
